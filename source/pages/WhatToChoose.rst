VedaOnline
----------
We need physical access to the model files in order to synchronize the model.
After downloading files from Git Hub we store them on file servers located on highly secured data centre in Finland.

INFORMATI0N SECURITY Certificate of Data/File Servers.

KanORS periodically test security of https://vedaonline.cloud/ through external Company. Only KanORS has the access to these servers. As a policy we do not access user’s Model Folder.

Veda2.0
-------
In case of Veda2.0, User’s model folder remains in their environment, so data security entirely depends at the user’s end. Also, user can share the saved Groups, Cases or Views through App Data folder (Inside Model Folder). Using GitHub for sharing is recommended.
