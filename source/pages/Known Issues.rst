Download run results and import
===============================
**Problem:** When downloading run results files from Jobs Dashboard, '~' character is automatically replaced by '_' character in file name by the browser.
If these files are used in Vd import functionality, the file import will fail. This behaviour is currently observed on Google Chrome.

**Workaround:**
    * Use Mozilla Firefox to download run results files from Jobs Dashboard.
    * Or, manually replace '_' character with '~' character in file name before using it with Vd import functionality.
